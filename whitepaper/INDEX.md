## Version History

### v1.0 — Governed Execution Foundation
**Published**: January 2026
**Status**: Current
**Availability**: [WHITEPAPER.md](./WHITEPAPER.md)
**PDF**: [governed_execution_whitepaper_v1.0.pdf](../whitepaper.pdf)

Defines the core thesis and architectural framework for governed execution:
- Why authorization, not intelligence, is the hard problem
- The liability shift from Read-Only to Read-Write AI
- Why existing patterns (logs, monitoring, API keys) fail
- The Keon Core → Runtime → Control architecture
- Evidence Packs and verifiable proof

**Key Claims**:
- Policy is enforced at the substrate, not in application code
- Every action produces receipts with lineage, attribution, and cost
- Humans approve, ratify, and intervene — with evidence
