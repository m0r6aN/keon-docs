# START_HERE: Welcome to Keon Systems

**30-second summary**: Keon is a governance substrate that proves AI decisions — before, during, and after execution. Policy is enforced at the infrastructure boundary. Every governed decision produces verifiable evidence.

---

## What Is Keon?

Keon is designed for governing AI and LLM-driven systems where decisions must be provable, auditable, and regulator-ready.

AI has crossed from advisory to operational. Enterprises deploy faster than they can control. Existing governance patterns fail at the infrastructure level.

Keon introduces a different model:

> **Execution proposes. Governance decides. Receipts prove.**

│  • Tamper-evident audit log             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Keon does not attempt to "explain" LLM internals. Instead, it governs **decision boundaries** around AI execution and answers questions such as:

- Under which policy was this output allowed?
- Where did human approval intervene?
- What constraints shaped the outcome?
- What evidence proves the decision path?

This shifts explainability from model introspection to **governance accountability**.

## Core Concepts

### Evidence Pack

The fundamental unit of proof. A tamper-evident bundle containing:

- **Decision**: What the AI was asked to do
- **Policy**: The governance rules that applied
- **Authority**: Who approved the decision (ALPHA system)
- **Execution**: What actually happened
- **Proof**: Cryptographic receipt proving all of the above

Evidence Packs are human-readable, machine-verifiable, and immutable. Sealed packs are stored in the **[Keon Evidence Vault][vault]** (append-only, write-once, read-only).

### ALPHA (Authority Layer for Policy Handling)

The human decision point. When policy requires human approval:

1. AI submits a decision request
2. ALPHA presents the decision to authorized human(s)
3. Human approves or rejects with explicit consent
4. System records decision + approval in Evidence Pack
5. Approved decision executes with full provenance

AI always operates under human authority, never autonomously overriding governance.

## FAQ

**How is Keon different from audit logging?**
Audit logging records what happened after the fact. Keon enforces policy before decisions execute and produces tamper-evident proof of enforcement.

**Do I need to trust Keon's implementation?**
No. Every claim is linked to verifiable proof. You can independently verify using the Proof Map.

**Can I use Keon with existing AI frameworks?**
Yes. SDKs integrate into existing code. Choose your language and follow the quick-start.

## Governance & Versioning

- **Versioned**: Each public claim is versioned separately in `canon/`
- **Immutable**: Published claims cannot be edited, only superseded
- **Governed**: Changes tracked in reconciliation ledger
- **Verifiable**: Every claim links to proof artifacts

**Current version**: v1.0 (January 2026)
